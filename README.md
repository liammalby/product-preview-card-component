## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla CSS
- HTML

### What I learned

This was a valuable exercise in which I refamiliarised myself with responsive design. I also revisited my understanding of `grid`, although ultimately I used a mixture of both `grid` and `flex`.

### Continued development

This is not quite perfect. I had trouble with positioning the footer. I would like to get it to basically stay in the same position on the page, but without overlapping the main card when the view height becomes too small. I tried a variety of methods, including `position: absolute` in the CSS, however I couldn't get it to work.
